# Introduction
Put project description here

# How to obtain this library?

There are several options in getting hands-on this library:

## 1. Via CLI (the simplest option)
```sh
curl -L zpl.pw/fetch > zpl.h
# OR
wget zpl.pw/fetch -O zpl.h
```

This approach will download the latest release of zpl with everything prepared for you.

## 2. Via GitHub releases page
* Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/zpl-c/skeleton/releases) of the zpl repository and pick the version you want to use. Each release contains the distributed version of zpl for you to use easily.

## 3. Cloning the repository
* Clone the repository by pressing the **Clone or download** button for instructions or use your terminal to clone:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zpl-c/zpl.git
```

We use this method to develop zpl as it contains all the development sources that are easy to modify and expand, but it is not suitable for use in production.

Please follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to learn how to contribute to the project.
